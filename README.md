# about
i thought it'd be fun to make an organization website bc i'm so busy nowadays! this website includes a to-do list and expense tracker. i tried to go for simple, modern-ish looking theme since it's easier for me to focus on. this was developed using html, css, and javascript in vscode! this was also developed as apart of hack club's athena award: [![Athena Award Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Faward.athena.hackclub.com%2Fapi%2Fbadge)](https://award.athena.hackclub.com?utm_source=readme)

# how to use
to-do list: type a task into the input box, then press the "+" button. press the "-" to remove.

expense tracker: determine what type of expense it is (payment, need, want). add the amount and date of the expense, then pres "+". if you made a mistake, press "-" to remove.

# struggles
i've never used the table tags in html before, so i had to do some research prior to getting started. i was a little confused with the tr, th, and td tags, but eventually figured it out. 
also, the styling seems like it would've been simple, but trying to align everything perfectly was an issue. honestly, the css is still pretty messy, so i want to try working on the responsiveness in the future.
